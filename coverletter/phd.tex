\lettersection{Why a PhD.}
After three years working in the private sector, I wanted to try something that had always captivated me: academic research. I wanted to challenge myself and be part of an environment where I could learn and explore new ideas with experienced researchers. I wanted to be part of the scientific community, where open source code and peer-reviewed journals are the norm. I wanted to be in the frontier of knowledge.

From my ongoing experience as a research assistant, I have confirmed that my choice was correct and that my passion for computer technologies and their application to solve real-world issues is genuine. I am confident in my abilities and am ready to take on the challenge of starting my Ph.D. at UVA, that will allow me to continue my research activities while also allowing me to engage with academia, both as a student and as a teaching assistant.
