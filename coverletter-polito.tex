\lettersection{Research interests.}
I am interested in multidisciplinary research projects that allow me to put to good use all the knowledge and skills in electronics and programming that I have acquired  during my academic and professional career. In particular, I am interested in bioinformatics, because of the impacts it can have on medical research, and the challenges it posses due to the large amounts of noisy data that needs to be analyzed, requiring high computational power and the use of innovative disciplines, such as machine learning.

\lettersection{Why DAUIN.}
Thanks to the advice of a colleague from my Master's, I decided to search for opportunities within the EDA group. My experience so far with professor Urgese has been great as it has allowed me to work in a multidisciplinary environment, learning and working on real-world problems and their solution using different edge technologies. The possibility to collaborate with external institutes, companies and researchers has been more than welcome, as well as the efforts of the department to encourage international collaborations with conferences and seminars
