    Embedded systems and their deployment in the real word has always captured my attention. This in conjunction with new
    emerging technologies for computational speed up, like neuromorphic architectures, and their integration with
    traditional ones like CPUs, GPUs and FPGAs is a topic I would love to investigate. Application wise, I am interested in bioinformatics
    because of the impacts it can have on medical research, and the challenges it posses due to the large amounts of noisy data that
    needs to be analyzed, requiring high computational power and the use of innovative disciplines, such as machine learning.
